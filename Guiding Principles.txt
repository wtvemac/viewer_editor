            The Super WebTV Viewer Pather (In-Place Editor) Tool 3.0

				Guiding Principles

This is the new version of the SuperViewer IPE.  It is meant to be more friendly 
and efficient than previous versions.  However, you still must understand that 
this is a very powerful and wanted tool.  I wish that you try to keep this tool 
tightly secured and make sure that you don't allow other people to download, use 
or even know that you have it.

Small paragraph but it should be clear to you.  Anyone who has this tool should 
know the importance of keeping things like this secret.

Why?

Because people sometimes make stupid decisions with tools like this and that 
makes it easier for Microsoft to find it.  The more people who have it, the more 
chance that it will be narked.

Why worry about Microsoft having this tool?

Should be obvious.  "Microsoft" want's to keep it's services "safe" and "secure" 
and to do that Microsoft needs to know the hackers (possibly you) who are 
working against their "mission" and how these hackers go about doing that.  For 
this point, Microsoft having a tool like this makes it harder for WebTV hackers 
to do continue with their hobby.

Thank you,
